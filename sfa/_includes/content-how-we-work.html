<h2>How will we work?</h2>
<p>Our role is to ensure that training packages, and therefore vocational qualifications, reflect employers’ and students’ needs, both now and in the future.</p>
<p>To do this we engage with employers and students across Australia, conduct detailed industry research and collaborate with experts in the vocational education sector before reviewing and developing training products.</p>
<p>Here’s how we do it:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The first, and most important, step we take is to listen to what employers are saying about their qualifications. We host <strong>forums</strong> and seek <strong>feedback</strong> from businesses about their current and future skills needs.</li>
	<li>Next, we combine this information with quantitative and qualitative data about the state of the economy and our industries to create <strong>Industry Intelligence</strong> plans. These plans will present the current and future states of our industries, their potential for growth and the types of skills employers need to remain productive and successful. Each of our six industries will have an updated plan every year and these will be published on this site. </li>
	<li>The <strong>Industry Intelligence plans</strong> help to identify areas where existing Training Packages are out of date or require new skills sets to be added. In some instances, where industries have made major leaps forward, an entirely new Training Package or Unit of Competency might be needed. These changes are put forward to our Industry Reference Committees in the form of a <strong>Business Case</strong>. The Business Case outlines what needs to be changed and why.</li>
	<li>When a Business Case is approved by our Industry Reference Committees, we can then get started on an approved <strong>Project</strong>, where we make changes to or rewrite the existing training package, or if necessary develop entirely new ones. Once the Project is completed and the training package has been approved by the AISC, it will be published on the Government’s site - training.gov.au.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How can you be involved?</h2>
<p>Skills for Australia’s vision is to put employer needs at the heart of the Government’s vocational education and training reform agenda. We can only do this by collaborating with industry and business across Australia to identify the skills our economy needs to thrive and grow. This means we want to hear feedback from you, talk to you and get your thoughts on what needs to change.
